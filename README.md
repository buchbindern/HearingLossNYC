# Hearing Loss in NYC compared to Greater New York

This project was made for a Linux Programming and Data Analysis class. 
It tests the hypothesis if NYC residents have more hearing loss than those in greater New York due to air pollution. 
I compared ear doctors per capita and the percent of people above and below age 65 in each New York zip code. If this data could prove my hypothesis, the resulting plot would show more doctors per capita in zip codes with a younger population in NYC compared to NYS.
